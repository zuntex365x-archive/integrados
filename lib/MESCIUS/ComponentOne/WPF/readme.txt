ComponentOne Studio WPF Edition
-----------------------------------

The folder [UserDocuments]\ComponentOne Samples\WPF contains all 
the samples that ship with this release. After installing the ComponentOne Studio WPF Edition, 
open Visual Studio 2010 or higher version and load any of the solutions available there: 
i.e. the ControlExplorer sample inside
[UserDocuments]\ComponentOne Samples\WPF\General\CS\ControlExplorer\. 

Each sample has a readme.txt file that contains basic information about the sample 
and its usage. To run a sample, right click the corresponding Application Project in the Solution 
Explorer, select "Set as Startup Project", and press F5.

For each of our libraries, we include the generic.xaml and each of the themes. 
i.e. You can find them for C1.WPF.4.dll at "[Installation  Folder]\WPF Edition\C1WPF.4\XAML".

For each of our libraries, we include the localization strings.
i.e. You can find them for C1.WPF.4.dll at "[Installation  Folder]\WPF Edition\C1WPF.4\Resources".

Also, we include the full change log for all the versions. 
You can find it at "[Installation  Folder]\WPF Edition\C1WPF.4\ChangeLog.html".
