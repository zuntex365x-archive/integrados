Starting with 2014v3 release, all ComponentOne assemblies included in Studio for 
WinForms have the same version (e.g. 4.0.20143.1), and must be kept in sync and 
updated together. The version's structure follows the general scheme that has 
been in use by individual controls previously, but the revision numbering has 
been re-started, so when comparing two versions of a particular C1 assembly 
which was previously released individually, it is necessary to first compare 
builds (the 3rd of the 4 dot- separated version numbers) prior to comparing 
revisions (4th number in version). The first two version numbers (major and 
minor versions) are used for special purposes (major number determines the 
target .NET version, minor is currently reserved) and should not be used to 
compare release dates. For example, version 4.6.20142.125 is older than version 
4.0.20143.1 even though the latter has both minor version (0) and revision (1) 
smaller than the former.

The current revision history of all products included in the ComponentOne Studio 
for WinForms (starting with the 2014v3 release) is located in a single file 
ChangeLog.html, grouped by release and product. Older readme files that were 
included in previous releases of individual controls are provided for reference 
in the directory OldReadmes also included in this drop.
