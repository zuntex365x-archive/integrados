            This method does exactly what ParentControlDesigner.EnableDesignMode does, but
            because we also need _disableDesignMode, this method is used for clarity.

            This method must be called for all components that _enableDesignMode was called on,
            when our design component is being removed (ComponentRemoving).
            Otherwise, the VS designer gets confused, e.g. the following sequence:
            - drop a C1DashboardLayout on the form;
            - delete it;
            - undo the deletion;
            - delete it again.
            results in junk in form's generated code - nested components that design mode was
            enabled for appear as standalone components on the form.
